          <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Water is the foundation of life, yet millions around the world face water scarcity every day.
            Climate change, pollution, and unsustainable usage are rapidly depleting this critical resource.
            By raising awareness and adopting water-saving practices, we can address these challenges together.
            Conserving water is not just an environmental necessity; it is a moral responsibility to ensure clean water access for current and future generations.
